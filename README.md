Using Node.js, we developed a website for a well-organized and easily-accessible Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) dictionary to allow Peace Corps volunteers to effectively learn KSL during their training period in order to teach KSL in Kenya. In addition to the lack of a standard dictionary, learning KSL is complicated by the many regional variations of words and phrases. With a visual language like KSL, a print dictionary is not effective, so our online dictionary provides videos for users to learn from. Improving on a past, pure-HTML, hard-coded version of the dictionary, we transferred data entries for the words into a MongoDB database, uploaded the videos onto YouTube to conserve memory, and implemented a search engine and upload capabilities for new dictionary entries.
